                The rapport and relationship you develop with your photographer is the key to achieving a stunning
                result. We will spend the time to really get to know you and talk you through how your event will go,
                providing you with friendly reassurance and support that will make the experience that extra bit
                special.

                We will provide comprehensive post production services including natural looking digital enhancements

            <h3>Author Bio</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is David Iming and I started Flash Imagery ten years ago. I am a Brisbane boy specialising in
                fashion, advertising, portraiture and weddings. After developing a keen interest in photography in early
                secondary school I went to train in Melbourne at what is considered to be the premier college of its
                type in Australia – Photographic Studies College in Southbank. Technical ability is just part of the
                puzzle and I am extremely proud of not only the skill that each of our photographers possess, but also
                their ability to connect with clients, models, subjects and audience alike to make each of them the
                complete photographer and a perfect choice for your project.</p>
